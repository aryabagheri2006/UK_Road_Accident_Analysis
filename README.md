UK Road Accident Analysis (Tableau)
This project analysed UK road accident data from 2019 to 2022, downloaded from Kaggle, with 33 fields and 660,679 rows. Using Tableau, I created KPIs to track total accidents, total casualties, fatal casualties, serious casualties, and slight casualties. The dashboard includes:
•	KPIs and Trends: Yearly trends for each KPI, showing percentage changes year-over-year.
•	Breakdowns of Serious Casualties: By vehicle type, weather condition, road surface, and location, providing insights into accident factors.
•	Filters: Added for current and previous years, as well as accident severity, to facilitate data exploration.
This analysis offers a comprehensive view of road safety trends, aiding in identifying high-risk factors for targeted safety improvements.
